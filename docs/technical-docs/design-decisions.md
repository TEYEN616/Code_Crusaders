## 01: Login Design

### First design idea

Status
: **Work in progress** 

Updated
: 21.05.2023

### Problem statement

Finding a basic design and a consistent design that runs through the entire application.

### Decision

![get_list_todos_sample](../assets/images/login_design_idea.png)


### Regarded options

It is supposed to reflect "clouds" and the "sky". on the game side the clouds are moved/pushed away and replaced by a bright starry sky. The registration page should be full of clouds. This is to symbolize how the page is first locked and then opened in the game.
