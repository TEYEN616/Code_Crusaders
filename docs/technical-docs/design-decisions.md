### Decision (as of yet)
![get_lists() sample](../assets/images/login-page.png)
![Alt text](../assets/images/register-page.png)

### Reasoning / Intention

It is supposed to reflect "clouds" and the "sky". on the game side the clouds are moved/pushed away and replaced by a bright starry sky. The registration page should be full of clouds. Thto is is symbolize how the page is first locked and then opened in the game.

### Reasoning / Intention
We haven't thought about our design for a long time. When we wanted to start at that point, we didn't like the stand. We opted for a much simpler design.
These two design examples show what our design looks like. We wanted to keep it simple and stick to one design and relieve ourselves of the work on this point.
