## Tim - review 

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

From my point of view Tim, as a collaborator in this project was forthcoming with a lot of Ideas. He did more than I expected him to do and was a driving factor in setting up the gameloop of the quiz web-application. Though we had different views on different ideas he was open and considerate for new ones.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

Our collaboration was based on respect and the experience of working with him akes me looking forward to work with him again. We both had phases in this project where we did not do a lot. But he always was very understanding and I good feeling about the project while working with him. 
[What positive or negative effect did this observation have on the reviewer?]

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

I liked working with him very much, but from the top of my head, other than keeping the good things about being forthcoming and also focussing more on planning ahead ahead, I dont have anthing left to say.
