# Peer review

## Tim - review 

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

From my point of view Tim, as a collaborator in this project was forthcoming with a lot of Ideas. He did more than I expected him to do and was a driving factor in setting up the gameloop of the quiz web-application. Though we had different views on different directions we wanted to take he was open and considerate.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

Our collaboration was based on respect and the experience of working with him akes me looking forward to work with him again. We both had phases in this project where we did not do a lot. But he always was very understanding and I good feeling about the project while working with him. 


### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

I liked working with him very much, but from the top of my head, other than keeping the good things about being forthcoming and also focussing more on planning ahead ahead, I dont have anthing left to say.


## Anton - review 

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)
Anton was always very open to my ideas and made it clear when he had suggestions for changes. Our collaboration was goal-oriented and, above all, very flexible thanks to Anton, even though he went to Australia. He did more than was often agreed and contributed his ideas.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)
Even though there were times when we both didn't actively work on our project, I never had the feeling that we couldn't make it. I really enjoyed working with him and would do it again.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)
He could rely a little more on his skills. He doesn't need to be nervous, the plan works with him without any problems. That's all
