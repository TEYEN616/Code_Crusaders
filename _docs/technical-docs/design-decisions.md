### Decision (as of yet)
![get_lists() sample](../assets/images/login-page.png)
![Alt text](../assets/images/register-page.png)

### Reasoning / Intention

It is supposed to reflect "clouds" and the "sky". on the game side the clouds are moved/pushed away and replaced by a bright starry sky. The registration page should be full of clouds. Thto is is symbolize how the page is first locked and then opened in the game.

These two design examples show what our design looks like. We wanted to keep it simple and stick to one design and relieve ourselves of the work on this point as well.
